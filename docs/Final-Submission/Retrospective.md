# Retrospective Summary
## Team performance and dynamics
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a team, we split up responsibility based on a rotating schedule of team roles. These roles were set up in our initial meeting to be predetermined and rotated after each 2-week milestone or sprint. A couple examples of our roles were Scrum Master and Scribe. The Scrum Master was in charge of leading the bi-weekly meetings, setting up the Zenhub board assignments and had final say of how we divided the sprint requirements between each team member. The scribe was in charge of documenting our team meetings so that we could look back over the key takeaways and important points from each meeting. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this was an online course, a challenge we faced was finding flexible times to meet virtually and discuss project requirements. Our team did very well at organizing a weekly schedule that worked for everyone and readjusting for different meeting times if something came up that disrupted our normal schedule. Even though it was difficult completing a semester-long project virtually, we prioritized meeting every week to ensure we completed all the necessary objectives for each milestone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One difficult aspect of this project was that we were not able to meet in person. This meant that most of our communication occurred through texting and team meetings. Because our primary form of communication was texting, we had to set boundaries, including a “quiet time” so we did not disturb the others with a barrage of texts. 

## Challenge categories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Kivy brought some interesting challenges. We were unable to find a good way to combine the console output and the console input into a single text box. Due to time constraints, we decided to split the console into two boxes, one for input and another for output. To get these working, we had to implement callback functions and use schedule_interval to let Kivy update the UI. This took us a significant ammount of time to get right.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with most software development projects, testing can be a difficult part. We struggled with completing unit tests alongside developing our source code. Project requirements often led to restructuring our code, which also made it difficult to develop new unit tests and change old ones to compensate for milestone requirements. In the end, we were able to develop a test script that covered 92% of the back-end code.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Milestone 5, the client requested that they be able to open several different uploaded files at the same time. It was challenging getting the tabs implemented in the GUI and the back-end in a way that kept everything looking neat and didn’t cause issues with other functions.

## Key takeaways
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on this project as part of a group was a valuable experience. Until now, most of our academic work has focused on individual assignments, so collaborating with a team offered a new perspective. It allowed us to experience both the benefits and challenges of teamwork such as improved communication, coordination, and problem-solving collectively. Overall, the project provided meaningful insight into the dynamics of working with others, something that can be taken into the real world and workforce.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning how to use git and GitHub improved our productivity dramatically. Using git allowed us to bring our code together more often, which allowed us to test our code together far more frequently. Without git, we would have had to each program a section of the application and hope it would integrate successfully.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the key objectives of this semester was to practice Agile methods in team software development. We were able to achieve this objective by using various tools like Github and Zenhub Boards to establish project requirements, distribute tasks, collaborate on code and documentation, and experience operating in various roles on a software development team.
