Code Inspection Checklist

core/gui.py class MemRegWidget(BoxLayout)

1. Code Formatting and Style
- Is the code consistently formatted?
Yes the code uses consistent indentation/spacing
- Are naming conventions followed for variables, functions, etc.?
Functions follow snake_case and class name is in PascalCase. Variable names are descriptive.

2. Correctness and Completeness
- Are all algorithms implemented correctly?
Memory is populated using a loop
- Are there any logical errors or incorrect assumptions?
There was a minor typo but has no been correct. Logical errors/assumptions should be resolved.

3. Efficiency
- Are there any unnecessary computations or redundant operations?
No obvious redundant computations.
- Can any parts of the code be optimized for better performance?
Scalability could be a concern if memory size needed to be increased. 

4. Error Handling
- Are potential errors or exceptions handled properly?
Edge cases are unlikely, especially in this controlled environment. Something like missing memory_box could be accounted for. 
- Is there appropriate input validation to prevent unexpected issues?
Memory inputs are set to readonly which prevents inlaid user edits.

5. Documentation and Comments
- Is the code well-documented, explaining the purpose and logic of complex sections?
There are no inline comments/docstrings. The function is straightforward, but adding explanations could improve readability.
- Are all functions and modules accompanied by comments describing their behavior?
Docstrings not present. Explanations would be useful.

6. Security
- Are there any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections or buffer overflows?
No direct security risk as the class only handles GUI rendering/readonly memory display.
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted and secured?
No sensitive data is used.

7. Portability and Maintainability
- Is the code written in a way that it can be easily adapted or modified?
Yes, row generation is flexible, particularly with theme/scale.
- Are there hard-coded values that could be replaced with variables or constants?
Yes because of the specific requirement of 100 memory locations.
