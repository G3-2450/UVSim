1. Code Formatting and Style
- Is the code consistently formatted?
The same blank space style is used throughout. 
- Are naming conventions followed for variables, functions, etc.?
Camel case is used for the variables and snake case is used for functions.

2. Correctness and Completeness
- Are all algorithms implemented correctly?
Yes. All of the algorithms work as expected
- Are there any logical errors or incorrect assumptions?
Yes. We were planning on passing in a callback function to BasicMLOps before we realized that only the read() function needed it. We instead recreated the read function in the UVSimCore class. To summarize, the __init__ and read() classes are not needed anymore.

3. Efficiency
- Are there any unnecessary computations or redundant operations?
- Can any parts of the code be optimized for better performance?
Yes. This class has many side effects, including printing to the console. This should not happen.

4. Error Handling
- Are potential errors or exceptions handled properly?
- Is there appropriate input validation to prevent unexpected issues?
multiply, subtract, add, store, load, and write functions do not have any error handling or input validation.

5. Documentation and Comments
- Is the code well-documented, explaining the purpose and logic of complex sections?
- Are all functions and modules accompanied by comments describing their behavior?
There is almost no documentation. There is a description from the assignment at the top for ease of access.

6. Security
- Are there any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections or buffer overflows?
- Is sensitive data properly encrypted and secured?
This program does not have sensitive data. I don't know anything about program security.

7. Portability and Maintainability
- Is the code written in a way that it can be easily adapted or modified?
- Are there hard-coded values that could be replaced with variables or constants?
More documentation would help. There are no magic values. The function side effects make it difficult to diagnose problems.
