***1. Code Formatting and Style***

- Is the code consistently formatted?

Yes, indentation looks great and remains consistent. Block structures are clearly defined

- Are naming conventions followed for variables, functions, etc.?

Yes, snake case is used in place of camelCase and PascalCase is used for class name.

***2. Correctness and Completeness***

- Are all algorithms implemented correctly?

Mostly, but one critical issue: accumulator = BasicMLOps.load(...) should be self.accumulator = ... or the updated value is lost.
Line self.program_counter on its own has no effect – likely a bug or unfinished line.

- Are there any logical errors or incorrect assumptions?

Yes, Branch instructions correctly use early return,

***3. Efficiency***

- Are there any unnecessary computations or redundant operations?

No obviously unnecessary operations. Instruction decode logic is minimal and concise.

- Can any parts of the code be optimized for better performance?

Could avoid repeatedly accessing self.memory[operand] by storing it once per step when needed.

***4. Error Handling***

- Are potential errors or exceptions handled properly?

Divide-by-zero is caught, but other exceptions (e.g., invalid opcodes) simply halt without a raised exception. Could benefit from clearer error propagation/logging.

- Is there appropriate input validation to prevent unexpected issues?

Yes, _handle_read() checks for int(value) conversion with try-except, which is appropriate.

***5. Documentation and Comments***

- Is the code well-documented, explaining the purpose and logic of complex sections?

Only some docstrings present. run_program(), step(), and load_program() could benefit from brief purpose/behavior comments.
- Are all functions and modules accompanied by comments describing their behavior?

Minimal inline comments. Logic like opcode decoding, accumulator assignment, and branching should be documented for clarity.

***6. Security***
- Are there any security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injections or buffer overflows?

Not applicable in this context – no external data connections, SQL, or user authentication involved.

- Is sensitive data properly encrypted and secured?

No sensitive data is handled.

***7. Portability and Maintainability***

- Is the code written in a way that it can be easily adapted or modified?

Some hardcoded logic (e.g., opcode definitions) could be improved with enums or constants to improve readability and reduce magic numbers.

- Are there hard-coded values that could be replaced with variables or constants?

Opcode values (10, 11, 20, etc.) are hardcoded. Recommend defining OP_READ = 10, etc., at the top for clarity and ease of change.
